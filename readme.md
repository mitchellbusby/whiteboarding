#whiteboarding

##intro

This is a delightful little whiteboarding application I put together, just the front end all built in redux and react.

I want to connect it to a backend, and it's been built in such a way that this should be relatively trivial, but for now I'm just doing the front end so I can focus on playing around with React and CSS animations :)


##getting started

install dependencies: 

`npm install`

run the code in dev mode: 

`npm start`

##developing

This codebase was scaffolded using a Yeoman generator, [generator-react-webpack-redux](http://github.com/stylesuxx/generator-react-webpack-redux/). It's a fork of generator-react-webpack.

I've made some minor edits to this scaffold, but haven't documented them formally. 

Unit tests, linting and code coverage is performed via

`npm test`

#whiteboarding

This is a delightful little whiteboarding application I put together, just the front end all built in redux and react.

I want to connect it to a backend, and it's been built in such a way that this should be relatively trivial, but for now I'm just doing the front end so I can focus on playing around with React and CSS animations :)
